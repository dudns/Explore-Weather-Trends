# Explore-Weather-Trends

This project is a part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). 

### Project Overview 
Among the full dataset including cities' and global average temperature, I chose to compare the temperature of Seoul with that of global, and the temperature of Toronto with that of Canada.
To see the trend, I merged data of Seoul and global, Toronto and Canada and visualized them in the same plot. 


### Getting Started 
You'll need to install :
* Python
