# Explore-Weather-Trends

This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project. 

Among the full dataset including cities' and global average temperature, I chose to compare the temperature of Seoul with that of global, and the temperature of Toronto with that of Canada.
To see the trend, I merged data of Seoul and global, Toronto and Canada and visualized them in the same plot.
